In a small village lived a farmer and his wife, described as decent folk. They have many children who are capable farm-hands, except for the youngest son who is intelligent but small and frail, and not suited for hard work. The parents decide the boy would be better off he became a priest, and he is accepted as an acolyte in training under the old priest of the village temple. Although the boy excelled as a student, he had the irresistible habit of drawing cats everywhere, including the margins of books, the temple's pillars, and all its screens, and is expelled. The priest warns the boy: "Avoid large places at night. Keep to the small".

The boy did not want to return to his father's farm for fear of punishment, and instead, he travels to the temple in the neighboring village, twelve miles away, hoping to be admitted as an acolyte there, not realizing all the priests living there have long-ago been driven away by a giant goblin-rat, and a number of warriors have gone missing after attempting to eradicate the goblin at night. The boy enters the deserted temple, which is dusty and cobwebbed. But he finds many big white screens to draw on, and finding a writing box (containing a brush), he ground some ink (i.e., ground inkstick on an inkstone), and drew cats on them.

Feeling drowsy, he was about to lie down to sleep by the screens, but recalls the old priest's words and climbs inside a little cabinet to go to sleep. During the night he hears horrible sounds of screaming and fighting. When morning comes and he finally climbs out, he discovers the corpse of the goblin-rat. As he wonders what could have killed it, he notices that all his cats now have blood on their mouths. He is hailed as a hero for defeating the monster, and grows up to be a famous artist.
