The story revolves around a girl called Little Red Riding Hood, after the red hooded cape that she wears. The girl walks through the woods to deliver food to her sickly grandmother. Her mother had ordered her to stay strictly on the path.

A stalking wolf wants to eat the girl and the food in the basket. He asks her where she is going. She tells him. He suggests that she pick some flowers as a present for her grandmother, which she does. In the meantime, he goes to the grandmother's house and gains entry by pretending to be Riding Hood. He swallows the grandmother whole and waits for the girl, disguised as the grandmother.

When the girl arrives, she notices that her grandmother looks very strange. She says, "What a deep voice you have!" "The better to greet you with", responds the wolf. "Goodness, what big eyes you have!" "The better to see you with", responds the wolf. "And what big hands you have!" "The better to embrace you with", responds the wolf. and lastly, "What a big mouth you have" "The better to eat you with!", responds the wolf. at which point the wolf jumps out of the bed and eats her, too. Then he falls asleep.
